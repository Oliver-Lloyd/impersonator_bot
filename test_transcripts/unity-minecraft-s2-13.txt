a strange land can Willoughby and fell

staircases in my day is impromptu
18:11
[Music]
18:13
what is that I know this song sounds
18:18
like it has a very pop song chord
18:20
progression it kind of sounds like
18:22
you're singing power by Kanye West we
18:29
need to make saddles boys you can thank
18:31
me later okay
18:33

18:36
when taken out of context but sure which
18:46
Dan what's your opinion on the new Kanye
18:48
West oh I think there's a couple
18:51
slappers on it but it's very different
18:54
you know than anything else these I
18:58
think it's unique do you like have you
19:01
heard it no I don't listen to albums
19:04
that I have under 60 on Metacritic
19:09
awesome where did you go Dan answers do
19:12
you like it um yeah I like it I do like
19:16
it I don't think it's something I listen
19:18
to every day but there are two slappers
19:20
that are every day listens oh yeah
19:23
have you listened to it well no I may I
19:28
listen know most of Kanye's I'm not in
19:33
any sort of rush yeah dude this they're
19:39
coming out with me some serious anxiety
19:41
oh no okay I've been saved that I saved
19:44
it huh the staircase kind of ends how do
19:49
you get lost on a staircase it's not
19:52
there's no rhyme or reason to it there
19:54
you're missing corners here and there
19:55
missing anything you just keep going up
19:58
this is like I've been those travel
20:00
pages where they're like did you walk up
20:02
this staircase to go to a Buddhist
20:04
temple absolutely not
20:06
how did you get over here because the
20:09
staircase ended it did not it comes out
20:11

20:15
experience it's right right here like I
20:19
figured it out but like I figure stuff
20:23
that's what I do how old are you guys I
20:25
figured it out but I'm just telling you
20:28
it's not very user-friendly it is I'm a
20:30
solution based individual if it doesn't
20:32
work for me you come up with your own
20:34
solution okay you're away away away two
20:37
seconds wait two seconds

22:04
thing that ambrosia tortures hey wait

27:40
vulnerable to just getting instantly hit

28:27
next space speedrun the staircase boys
28:31

28:38

28:47

29:01
really know how but that's okay he's
29:04
very he's very very quick
29:08
do you not die no I definitely still
29:12
died
29:16
I just want to know else
29:18
he's a boy shoot why did he just full
29:22
heel oh yeah he did it again did you die
29:27
offs no I just got knocked off oh well I
29:30
guess it's like we should get better
29:37
yeah I think like bows and arrows would
29:41
be pretty really his immune to them is
29:44
what I was told oh well maybe just more
29:48
better sword sir maybe we need to like
29:53
make the wall higher feel me better
29:57
we did but why we're not not hitting him
30:02
we're just falling on a very much
30:03
damaged doing low damn well we still
30:06
won't like we like out of a third the
30:07
way down one more thing I'm just gonna
30:08
make us not hit him bird not him not hit
30:11
us
30:11
do we kill him faster you know if we
30:14
just build the wall higher then he won't
30:16
hit us off yeah I said it might affect
30:19
his ability to like I bet you can make
30:22
it like a little bit higher and we have
30:23
all four of us and we don't get hit off
30:26
as much
30:39
okay I don't know okay let's go find
30:48
some stuff to make better Danna and okay
31:13
yeah I was just looking in the menu so
31:23
we going back into old because I died
31:25
you lose your gold when you die yeah no
31:30
yeah you don't
31:34
so are we building the wall are we
31:37
getting better what I mean I I think
31:39
we're getting better weapon I'm half way
31:41
to building it up one layer never mind
31:45
I've 973 gold yeah in fact it was just
31:49
bugged I will be right back boys off I
31:58
will help you all right
32:00
like 2/3 done the first layer I think
32:04
it's not gonna be pretty but
32:10
guys I'm coming and I'm bringing the
32:16
cavalry
32:18
we got machine guns like Henry Cavill I
32:21
wish just for no reason
32:25
how do you craft arrows I think you need
32:29
feather and don't you need flint for
32:32
like the arrow and who's in there a
32:36
better way
32:37
just type arrow and it'll tell you there
32:41
on the bottom right if so many arrows
32:45
arrow butterfingers two three aerogel is
32:50
in essence a normal arrow is one Flint
32:53
one stick and one feather that's not
32:58
possible
33:00
anyway I opened a mega loot box and got
33:03
the Eagle riot a legendary bow that's
33:08
like maybe the most diss unified thing
33:12
tonight
33:12
it's my goal but we were gonna make
33:15
Omega we need to kill the boss we are
33:20
making the wall bigger and that might be
33:23
enough if we can stop getting eat it off
33:26
because his health resets like we had
33:30
them down to almost half health a couple
33:32
times
33:32
alright I'm coming back anyway I will
33:37
help you build that wall so I think we
33:40
just put it up two levels I've got some
33:46
more material I don't know how much Dan
33:48
has
33:49
I can get started on on the third but
33:55
I'm bringing a bunch
34:05
the gospel roofing night getting a CD
34:08
for sure
34:11
Bunch what do you think is good oh well
34:19
he had Thai food the other day cream of
34:25
some young guy he's alright hey I know
34:39
chicken sir
34:44
so much in Misawa just like head chicken
34:50
raw chicken breast
34:53
Raising Cane's it's fried I prefer
34:59
raising Arizona's but now if I was
35:03
surprised by how many people keep rushed
35:05
to the defensive chicken in your taco
35:08
poll somebody had the nerve to describe
35:12
it as the perfect protein I like I like
35:16
chicken overall as it as a meat but I
35:22
don't think that means it's like the
35:24
best for taco I got nothing
35:28
like against ya a chicken taco if you
35:32
were like can I have a chicken thigh
35:33
I'll give you a chicken taco right now I
35:35
would say please do yeah but the amount
35:38
of people who are like it's easily the
35:41
best protein like it's the best meat for
35:43
every single purpose I was like dude
35:46
you're you're missing out I urge the
35:51
panel I would probably agree with that
35:54
yeah
35:56
but that doesn't mean it's like just the
36:00
most tasty best that's I think like if
36:04
I'm picking one eye and it was Louis I'm
36:06
not really too surprised but I really
36:10
love fish tacos do these fish top people
36:12
are sleeping
36:13
I agree like but the the take I liked
36:19
was ideally in a real world scenario you
36:22
get like one of each that to me is
36:24
perfect because when I get tacos I
36:28
usually get a chicken beef in a shroom
36:32
feel like if I had three shrimp tacos a
36:35
big you know after the first one or
36:39
maybe two a big all right that's good
36:40
shrimp is great to eat at home but in a
36:46
dining setting they overvalue it so much
36:50
that I don't even want to interface with
36:51
it here's what you do you take very tiny
36:54
tiny cubes of steak you brown them and
36:58
crisp on my knee child little chopped up
37:00
onion and a little bit of lime juice
37:03
that's the perfect carne asada yeah yeah
37:09
oh what's the what's the one that Dan
37:13
tossed the name for the beef cheek that
37:15
are the car
37:19
that's not beef cheek it just is the way
37:23
you cook so it can be beans just on a
37:26
charcoal barbacoa
37:29
[Music]
37:31
what I just did this whale the old
37:35
onesie twosie honestly I would wait
37:39
would it mean we got the Eagle Crest
37:42
with Ryan gay go ahead I don't have any
37:44
arrows so I'd prefer to wait as well
37:51
we need the materials to build the wall
37:53
slightly higher I mean we did build the
37:55
wall like oh yeah but like the thing is
37:59
we can also build it with one tile gaps
38:03
and then reused oh he is on it but he's
38:08
quite smart dude I mean if when it comes
38:11
to building something the right way I'm
38:12
not your guy but when it comes to goofy
38:15
cut around the cloud you can move
38:18
through the cloud okay okay when it
38:20
comes to goofy solutions that should not
38:22
work but might I'm your man
38:27
stupid networks is it stupid absolutely
38:30
true God what is this song it's this
38:32
song sounds like the chord progression
38:34
of a box okay get it I can't think of it
38:37
eine kleine Nachtmusik probably a
38:40
nickelodeon cartoon mid-90s good
38:53
talk about some Kensington a few weeks
38:56
ago I'm got something well what's a call
38:57
cuz I is that that fish and chips place
39:01
to tell my parents I was like go there
39:05
is my dad that's that's how he measures
39:08
a lot of places think do they got good
39:12
fish I don't know and I like fish and
39:16
chips but I was like there's a good fish
39:18
and chips place we could Joey's only I'm
39:31
starting to dislike fish and chips
39:32
having honestly kind of with you know
39:38
much better
39:40
no that's you gotta get a good one that
39:42
doesn't do too much I wouldn't say I
39:45
dislike them that's too far but the
39:47
number of times I've ordered it from an
39:49
establishment has gone you know let's
39:52
say like from 15 to 25 percent of the
39:57
time is now I like zero I would still
40:02
eat it if it was around but I almost
40:06
never order it Oh baby it's just my own
40:09
with fried foods in general lately if I
40:11
bite into the food and I can only taste
40:13
fried not the food there's a problem I'm
40:18
honest I didn't expect to be there but
40:20
I'm kind of with you when you bite into
40:22
like some bready battering and then you
40:25
just get like a mouthful of oil I agree
40:30
with that
40:30
I feel like bad fish and chips best
40:32
that's like no batter based fried food
40:40
no all right so I'm just gonna run my
40:42
chopper if the whale runs into it that's
40:45
his decision
40:48
let me get off the hook
40:51
I just don't think that pride does fish
40:54
justice I mean I like fish anyway I can
40:58
get it but a good pattern he's not
41:05
getting involved how do we start with
41:13
this oh you know I think the wall is
41:19
high enough I think we're gonna be okay
41:21
oh yeah oh we just got to stay out of
41:24
the whirlwind see ether-wall I think the
41:27
thing is has to be flat on the ground
41:30
well let's see you get it as a highlight
41:33
so I do you think the wall is maybe
41:38
affecting them and we need a little
41:43
bunker like in factory oh no ok we got
41:47
oh you know we should do mouth craft
41:58
some tnt and throw it on the ground I
42:00
don't got any gunpowder this is why I
42:04
said give me gunpowder I got I don't
42:06
anybody got powder I haven't been old no
42:07
no yeah what do you think is your the
42:09
one with the pet creeper just harvested
42:11
I'm inside of his harvested forehead all
42:15
right boys nice work so far I'm trying
42:22
yeah he's down to 10% chop them up yeah
42:34
led by the little belly oh yeah you guys
42:46
feel like you're whipping on like 80% of
42:48
your shots ah maybe yeah
42:54
this means we already cut that
42:56
tenderloin out oh really that I slowed
43:02
into the ground yeah look at that red
43:05
bar look at that red bar go down here we
43:08
got one third whoa nice try bub
43:14
ice them up something proper I think we
43:32
got yeah yeah just long we don't get you
43:35
eat it off the song that I could hear
43:44
play that to this song Jason Mraz's I'm
43:48
Yours Oh dunk dunk dunk dunk dunk dunk
43:53
dunk dunk don't disrespect the song like
43:56
that was it your wedding song no this
44:01
song all's forgiven I'm ty I'm bringing
44:06
this song box back to this boy's self
44:10
it's his right back he's down to about
44:19
35% you took it I stepped on it and it
44:36
broke I didn't know it was one of those
44:39
blocks that breaks when you step on it
44:47
honestly I think that one gap difference
44:50
is the difference in getting heated and
44:52
not over the wall this guy he cannot
44:57
hurt me and every time I hit him I see
44:59
like at least 2% of his HP go down bison
45:15
i key changed it fucked me Austin don't
45:29
fly off okay we have I will never get it
45:36

46:13

Hellfire boys that we found that's a
53:23
different boss so we gotta probably make
